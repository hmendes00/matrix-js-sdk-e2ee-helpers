# matrix-js-sdk-e2ee-helpers
This REPO is intent to help people having a hard time to setup e2ee using matrix-js-sdk.

# DISCLAIMER

I am not good at e2ee so I don't understand basic concepts of it. I tried to compile some of the functions that I am using that might help someone else as well.
If you understand it and believe some parts could be improved, feel free to do so.

This should be a collaborative REPO to help people have this setup with less headaches.

I'll try to explain when each function should be called in the next topic.

One more thing:
Every here reflects my experience setting up this in my Ionic + Vue project.
It might not be exactly the same thing for someone else, but hopefully it will still
help them somehow.

#How to use it

One of the libraries used for encryption is Olm so you will need to install it as well (at least I had to)
(I AM ADDING MY CURRENT PACKAGE.JSON to this project as well)
